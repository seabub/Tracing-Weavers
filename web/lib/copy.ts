/**
 * Every word a visitor reads, in one place.
 *
 * Written against the Ogilvy principles (skill: ogilvy-copywriting), in ENGLISH:
 * the interface speaks English and the craft keeps its own words as a gloss
 * (tenun, ikat, mengkudu). Proper nouns stay as they are — a weaver's name is
 * not translated.
 *
 * The rules the copy is held to:
 *  · one promise per surface, in plain words: "this cloth has a name"
 *  · the framing said out loud: a birth record for the cloth
 *  · facts instead of praise: eleven weeks, three dye baths, three districts
 *  · short sentences, one idea each
 *  · nothing explains the machinery to a visitor before it earns it
