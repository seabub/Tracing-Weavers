# Deploy & connect — Digital Product Passport

Everything below is one-time setup, in order. Nothing here needs a wallet, a
chain or a contract.

## 0. What connects to what

```
GitHub repo (this one)
  └── Vercel project  ── Root Directory: web ──►  build: npm run build
        ├── env vars ──► NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL   (the domain the tags carry)
        │                NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND
        │                PASSPORT_SIGNING_SECRET
        └── storage ───► Vercel KV (PASSPORT_STORE=kv)
  └── your domain ─────► must equal NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL
  └── NFC tag / QR ────► https://<domain>/t/<TAG_CODE>
        └── data/tags.json ──► which record
              └── data/records.json ──► the story
```

## 1. Git → Vercel

1. Vercel → **Add New → Project → Import Git Repository** → `seabub/Tracing-Weavers`.
2. **Root Directory: `web`** (Edit → set `web`). The design-system files in the
   repo root are not part of the app, and the root `vercel.json` (which serves
   `stage.html`) must not be used for it.
3. Framework preset: **Next.js**. Build `npm run build`, output default.
4. Deploy. The first deploy works without any env var except the site URL.

## 2. Environment variables

Vercel → Project → **Settings → Environment Variables**. Add each to
**Production** and **Preview**:

| Name | Value | Where it comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | `https://passport.example.org` | the domain you will put the tags on — **set this before burning tags** |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND` | `Digital Product Passport` | shown in the shell |
| `PASSPORT_SIGNING_SECRET` | `openssl rand -hex 32` | your machine; changing it invalidates session cookies, not stored passports |
| `PASSPORT_STORE` | `kv` | see step 3 (Upstash from the Vercel Marketplace) |
| `KV_REST_API_URL` | injected | Upstash / KV integration |
| `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` | injected | Upstash / KV integration |

After adding them: **Deployments → ⋯ → Redeploy** (env changes only apply to new
deployments).

## 3. A store for issued passports

`PASSPORT_STORE=file` writes `data/passports.json`, which works locally and on a
self-hosted box but **not on Vercel** (read-only filesystem).

Vercel → **Storage** opens a Marketplace; the choice that needs **no extra code**
here is:

| Provider in the list | Use it? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Upstash** — Serverless DB (Redis, Vector, Queue, Search) | **yes, recommended** | Redis over REST. `lib/store.ts` already speaks it, no SDK. |
| Redis (official) | yes | Redis protocol, not REST — would need the `redis` client instead of plain fetch. |
| Neon · Supabase · Prisma Postgres · Nile | possible | SQL. Swap the adapter in `lib/store.ts`; the table schema is in the comment at the top of that file. |
| Turso (SQLite) · MongoDB Atlas · Convex · MotherDuck · Mem0 | possible | Same seam, different driver. |

1. Storage → Marketplace → **Upstash** → create, region **Singapore**.
2. **Connect** it to this project, both Production and Preview.
3. The integration injects the REST url + token. Either naming works:
   `KV_REST_API_URL` / `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` (legacy) or
   `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` / `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`. Set
   `PASSPORT_STORE=kv`.
4. Redeploy. `/api/passports` returns `"backend":"kv"` when it is wired up.

## 4. Domain

1. Vercel → Settings → **Domains** → add `passport.example.org`, follow the DNS
   instructions (CNAME or the two A records).
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to **exactly** that domain, including `https://`
   and no trailing slash. Redeploy.
3. Check: open `https://<domain>/t/BT-0042` — it should redirect to
   `https://<domain>/record/BT-0042?tag=BT-0042`.

> HTTPS is required: the in-page NFC reader (Web NFC on Android Chrome) only
> works on a secure origin, and iOS reads the tag from the lock screen without
> any of this.

## 5. Tags — burning the URL

Each tag carries exactly one NDEF **URI** record:

```
https://<domain>/t/<TAG_CODE>
```

1. Generate the list: `cd web && npm run nfc:urls` → prints the table and writes
   `data/tags.csv`.
2. Write the chips. Any of these works; pick per volume:
   - **Phone, few tags:** *NFC Tools* (Android/iOS) → Write → Add a record → URL
     → paste → Write. For a batch, the Pro version takes a list.
   - **Desk, many tags:** an ACR122U / PN532 reader with *NFC Tools for Desktop*
     or `nfcpy`, feeding it `data/tags.csv`.
   - **Flipper Zero:** NFC → Write → URL.
3. Lock the tag read-only once it is verified, so a passer-by cannot re-point it.
   Do this *after* confirming the URL opens the right record.
4. Test with a real phone before the tag goes into the product:
   - iPhone: hold the top edge to the tag, no app — a banner appears.
   - Android: NFC on, hold to the tag, tap the notification/banner.

### Where to put the tag

Chip position is a product decision; the registry already carries a note per tag
in `data/tags.json` (`"position": "Selvedge, 4 cm from the fringe"`). Metal and
moisture kill NFC range — keep a few millimetres of cloth between chip and any
metal fitting, and never sew through the antenna.

### QR, in parallel

The same URL can be printed as a QR on the packaging for phones without NFC.
Generate it with any QR tool from the `url` column of `data/tags.csv`; the app
treats a QR scan and a tag tap identically (`/t/<TAG_CODE>`).

## 6. Adding a record (product) later

```bash
cd web
# 1. add a row to data/records.json (code, title, description, supply, attributes)
npm run record:svg        # 2. artwork → public/records/<CODE>.svg (geometry-checked)
npm run nfc:urls          # 3. get the URL for the new tag
# 4. add the tag row to data/tags.json
npm run publish           # 5. verify all three agree (--fix fills missing tag rows)
git add -A && git commit -m "Add record <CODE>" && git push
```

Vercel deploys on push. The tag now opens the new record — no redeploy of
anything else, no key to rotate.

## 7. Post-deploy checklist

Run these against the real domain:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://<domain>/                 # 200
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://<domain>/scan             # 200
curl -sI https://<domain>/t/BT-0042 | grep -i location                     # /record/BT-0042?tag=BT-0042
curl -s https://<domain>/api/passports | head -c 200                       # "backend":"kv"
```

Then, in a browser:

1. Open `/record/BT-0042`, claim it with a real name + email → a passport id
   (`DPP-BT0042-0001-XXXX`) appears, and the success dialog offers the passport.
2. Open `/verify/<that id>` in a private window → "Verified in the register".
3. `/collection` with the same email → the passport is listed.
4. Claim the same one-of-one record from a *different* email → refused (409),
   the button reads "All passports issued".
5. From a phone, tap a real tag → the record opens with the "Tag read" badge.

## 8. When something does not work

| symptom | cause | fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Links on tags still point at localhost | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` left at the default | set it, redeploy |
| `/record/...` shows "no record" (404 page) | `code` in `data/records.json` does not match the tag's `record` value | `npm run publish` lists orphans |
| Tag opens the site but not a record | tag's URL has no `/t/`, or the code is not in `data/tags.json` | rewrite the tag / add the row |
| Claim succeeds but `/collection` is empty | store not configured (`file` on Vercel), or you signed in with a different email | connect Upstash, `PASSPORT_STORE=kv`; use the claiming email |
| In-page "Start reading" button missing | browser is not Android Chrome, or the origin is not HTTPS | expected — use the camera or the QR |
| Passport id verifies but "signature only" | store is `file` on Vercel, or the Redis env vars are missing on that deployment | connect Upstash, redeploy |
| `npm run record:svg` exits 1 | a trait label would reach its value, or the copy overruns the footer | shorten the value in `data/records.json`; the message names the row |

## 9. What is public

Everything a tag can reach is public: `data/records.json`, `data/tags.json` and
`/verify/<id>` are readable by anyone with the URL. Never put a phone number, a
price, a full address or anything a maker did not agree to publish in those
files. `data/passports.json` holds holder names and emails — gitignore it if the
repo is not private.
